          The ‘Aims’ of the NCC laid out in 1988 have stood the test of time and
          continue to meet the requirements expected of it in the current
          socio–economic scenario of the country. The NCC aims at developing
          character, comradeship, discipline, a secular outlook, the spirit of
          adventure and ideals of selfless service amongst young citizens.
          Further, it aims at creating a pool of organized, trained and
          motivated youth with leadership qualities in all walks of life, who
          will serve the Nation regardless of which career they choose. Needless
          to say, the NCC also provides an environment conducive to motivating
          young Indians to join the armed forces.

          The NCC flag for various units of the NCC was first introduced in
          1951. The flag was of same pattern, colour and size as was used by
          various regiments of the Army. The only difference was that it had the
          NCC badge and unit designation placed in the centre. Later on it was
          felt that the flag should be in keeping with the inter-service
          character of the Corps. In 1954 the existing tricolour flag was
          introduced. The three colours in the flag depict the three services of
          the Corps, red for the Army, deep blue for the Navy and light blue for
          the Air Force. The letters NCC and the NCC crest in gold in the middle
          of the flag encircled by a wreath of lotus, give the flag a colourful
          look and a distinct identity.
